# Sketch-It-Yourself
Do-It-Yourself (DIY) projects come in all shapes and sizes.  They can range from small home improvements such as putting up shelves, to assembling furniture, all the way up to building sheds.  Whatever the project, "DIYers" often find it helpful to be able to quickly draw out plans they might have on the back of an envelope or other scrap piece of paper.  Normally these drawings will be rough and imprecise, however with the aid of computer software the task of creating more accurate drawings has the potential to be made much easier.

This web-app attempted to do just that, by falling somewhere in-between advanced CAD software and popular drawing packages. Possessing technical features useful to a DIYer such as automatic measurement generation and scale adjust while still being usable with little needed in the way of training.
